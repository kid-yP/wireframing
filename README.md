# 🧩 Wireframing

## 📌 What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process that acts as the blueprint of a website or application. It outlines the **basic layout and structure** without including design elements like color, images, or typography. Wireframes focus on **content placement, navigation flow, and user interface structure**.

## 🚀 Why Wireframing Matters

- ✅ **Clarifies Ideas**  
  Translates abstract concepts into tangible, visual representations.

- ✅ **Improves Communication**  
  Keeps designers, developers, and stakeholders aligned on structure and functionality.

- ✅ **Uncovers Usability Issues**  
  Helps detect problems with flow, navigation, and interaction early.

- ✅ **Saves Time and Cost**  
  Fixing layout issues at this stage is faster and cheaper than during development.

- ✅ **Provides Structure**  
  Lays out headers, footers, content blocks, and navigation for a clear UI skeleton.

- ✅ **Easy to Revise**  
  Simple to modify during brainstorming or feedback rounds.

- ✅ **Guides the Design Process**  
  Acts as a reference throughout design and development phases.

- ✅ **Focuses on UX**  
  Without visual distractions, teams can zero in on usability and flow.
